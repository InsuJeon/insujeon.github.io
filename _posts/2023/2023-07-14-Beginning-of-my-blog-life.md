<!-- # Beginning of my blog life -->

I'v been working on the subject of machine learning and statistics for a couple of years, especially in computer vision, perusing Ph.D in a graduate school. At some moment, I could’t bear the scattering knowledge which once come to me and fade away almost surely. Thus, I decided to keep track of my daily studies and progress in this blog.

However, it is of course not only subjected to the domain of my study or knowledge but rather my feeling, though, and memory will take places in or perhaps could be more dominantly presented. Therefore, this blog is on the purpose of describing my random world using carefully chosen words, which also reflects my preference of simplicity and the reason of the blog title being “minimal description length”.

The quotation “Read, pause, think, pause, write, pause, (perhaps erase), pause, read, pause, (perhaps go back), pause, write, …” by Alan Turing (1936) describes the principle of how machine works, such as computer. However, it is also how we, human, learn, and must be the only way we acquire our knowledge as far as I understand. I will try to write something constantly. It could sometime be paused, but it will eventually be resumed. I hope this could work as a records of my progress on which I could bring more in the future.
