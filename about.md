# Insu Jeon

Hello, I am a person who is interested in innovating the world with Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology for human well-being and happiness.

I graduated from [UCLA](https://www.ucla.edu/) with a major in [Computer Science](https://samueli.ucla.edu/) and a minor in [Statistics](http://statistics.ucla.edu/).

I graduated from [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) with a Ph.D. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/en) under the supervision of [Prof. Gunhee Kim](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/gunhee/index.html#top) in the [Vision & Learning Lab](https://vision.snu.ac.kr/). I was under [Prof. SI Yoo](https://cse.snu.ac.kr/professor/%EC%9C%A0%EC%84%9D%EC%9D%B8) in the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory during my master's period.

I have participated in various Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects, including [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision), [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [Bayesian deep learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network), [Generative model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_model), [meta-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-learning_(computer_science)), and [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning).

I have an [entrepreneurship](https://www.nextunicorn.kr/company/1a8415a41e121755) experience where I learned valuable lessons to be a tech-leader.

Here is my [CV]( {{ site.url }}/data/InsuJeon_cv2023.pdf ).
